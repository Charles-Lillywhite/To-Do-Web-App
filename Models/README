This is where we define the application's data models, and the relationship between the data objects

Django's object-relational tools will map the data we define into database tables.

In this application we have two types of data object:
1 - ToDoList (with a title)
2 - ToDoItem (with title, description, created date, due date), belonging to a given ToDoList

In this Python code we define our two data objects using classes. See the comments on the file for a description of how everything works!
